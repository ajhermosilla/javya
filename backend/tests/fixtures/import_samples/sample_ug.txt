Blessed Be Your Name by Matt Redman

Capo: 2
Key: A

[Verse 1]
A                    E
Blessed be Your name in the land that is plentiful
F#m                D
Where Your streams of abundance flow
A                 E
Blessed be Your name

[Verse 2]
A                    E
Blessed be Your name when I'm found in the desert place
F#m                     D
Though I walk through the wilderness
A                 E
Blessed be Your name

[Pre-Chorus]
        F#m           E
Every blessing You pour out I'll
D                A
Turn back to praise
        F#m           E
When the darkness closes in Lord
D
Still I will say

[Chorus]
A                   E
Blessed be the name of the Lord
         F#m
Blessed be Your name
D
Blessed be the name of the Lord
         A              E    D
Blessed be Your glorious name

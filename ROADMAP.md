## How to Contribute

We prioritize features that help worship teams serve their communities better. If you'd like to contribute:

1. **Discuss first** — Open an issue to discuss the feature before coding
2. **Keep it simple** — Non-technical worship leaders should find it intuitive
3. **Test thoroughly** — It must work reliably every Sunday

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development guidelines.

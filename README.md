# 🎵 Javya

**Open-source worship planning for church teams.**

Javya (from Guaraní *javy'a* — "let us rejoice together") is a web-based platform that helps worship teams manage songs, build setlists, and export presentations. Born in Asunción, Paraguay.

## The Problem

Most worship teams juggle disconnected tools:

- Google Sheets for scheduling
- PowerPoint for lyrics (inconsistent templates, missing verses)
- Songbook Pro for chords
- WhatsApp for coordination
- YouTube links scattered everywhere

Javya consolidates this into one reliable tool.
